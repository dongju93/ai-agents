## Predicted Interview Questions

1. Compare Django vs. FastAPI: when and why choose each?
2. Explain Pydantic’s role in data validation/serialization.
3. How do you design and optimize PostgreSQL schemas for high-throughput?
4. Describe caching patterns with Redis (cache-aside, Pub/Sub).
5. Walk through your Docker multi-stage build process.
6. When to use AWS Lambda vs. ECS for microservices?
7. How do you structure unit vs. integration tests in Pytest?
8. Illustrate a system-design: fault-tolerant, scalable REST API.
9. Give an example of resolving a production performance issue.
10. Behavioral: handle conflicting priorities in an agile team.

## Questions to Ask Them

- Team & Process
  1. “How is the backend pod structured, and what’s the typical sprint cadence?”
  2. “How do you balance new features versus technical debt each sprint?”
- Product & Metrics  
  3. “What are the next major platform features, and how is success measured?”  
  4. “Which performance SLAs or business KPIs are top priorities?”
- Tech Stack & Evolution  
  5. “Why FastAPI for public endpoints, and how do you ensure consistency with Django?”  
  6. “Any plans to adopt Kubernetes or other orchestration beyond ECS?”
- Growth & Culture  
  7. “What training resources or mentorship programs do you offer?”  
  8. “How do you maintain collaboration and culture in a hybrid environment?”  
  9. “What are the key milestones for a new hire in the first 90 days?”

## Concepts To Know/Review

- Python async/await and event loops
- Django (ORM, admin) vs. FastAPI (Pydantic, async routes)
- REST vs. GraphQL trade-offs
- PostgreSQL indexing, normalization, partitioning
- Redis caching patterns & Pub/Sub messaging
- Docker best practices: multi-stage builds, image optimization
- AWS services: Lambda event triggers, ECS deployment, S3 policies, IAM roles
- CI/CD workflows: GitHub Actions, test coverage gates, linters
- Testing strategies: unit, integration, mocking external services
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, distributed tracing basics

## Strategic Advice

- **Tone**: Confident, concise, solution-oriented; use “we” for teamwork
- **Focus**: Emphasize architecture decisions, quantifiable performance gains, and leadership in code reviews
- **Examples**: Lead with metrics (e.g., “reduced response time by 40%”), clarify trade-offs made
- **Red Flags**:
  - Relocation/time-zone: Proactively address hybrid schedule and moving timeline
  - Over-engineering: Balance innovation with maintainability
- **Closing**: Reiterate excitement for TrueNorth’s mission, highlight adaptability to hybrid/remote culture, ask about next steps and feedback process
