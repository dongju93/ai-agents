**Location:** Seoul, South Korea (Onsite)  
**Type:** Full-time, 50M–60M KRW/yr  
**Core Responsibilities:**

- Design, develop, and maintain scalable backend services using Python and FastAPI
- Implement and optimize data storage with PostgreSQL and Redis
- Containerize and orchestrate services with Docker & Kubernetes
- Write unit/integration tests and participate in code reviews
- Collaborate with frontend, product, and DevOps teams to deliver performant APIs

## Why This Job Is a Fit

- **Strong Technical Alignment:** You have 5 years of Python development and deep expertise in FastAPI, matching the 3+ year requirement and key technology stack.
- **Container & Cloud Expertise:** Proven Docker and Kubernetes experience lines up with their DevOps practices.
- **Performance & Scale:** Your record of optimizing latency (30%+ reduction) and handling high-throughput data pipelines suits ABC’s “performance & reliability” culture.
- **Collaboration & Growth:** Your cross-functional work with product and frontend teams echoes their emphasis on teamwork; the role’s project-lead opportunities align with your career progression goals.

## Resume Highlights for This Role

- **FastAPI & Async Services:** Architected FastAPI-based microservices serving 10k+ requests/day; used Pydantic models & async patterns.
- **Data Layer Mastery:** Designed multi-database solutions with PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching, and Elasticsearch for search index.
- **Containerization Pipeline:** Built Docker images (multi-stage builds) and deployed to Kubernetes clusters; automated health checks and rollouts.
- **Testing & Quality:** Achieved >90% coverage with Pytest; integrated static analysis tools (MyPy, Ruff) and pre-commit hooks.
- **Monitoring & Reliability:** Set up Prometheus + Grafana + Loki for metrics/log aggregation; implemented Redis Pub/Sub for event-driven flows.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:** Partnered with product in API contract design; mentored juniors via code reviews and sprint demos.

## Company Summary

**ABC Corp** (201–500 employees) is a Seoul-based software firm specializing in cloud-native backend platforms.

- **Product Focus:** High-performance, scalable API services—likely for enterprise or consumer apps.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes.
- **Culture & Values:**
  - _Performance & Reliability_ – Emphasis on low-latency, fault-tolerant systems
  - _Collaboration_ – Tight, cross-functional feedback loops
  - _Continuous Improvement_ – Automated testing, code reviews, CI/CD
  - _Innovation_ – Adoption of modern frameworks and cloud-native tooling

## Predicted Interview Questions

**Technical:**

1. Walk us through your FastAPI project. How did you handle concurrency and dependency injection?
2. How do you design and version a RESTful API? What trade-offs versus GraphQL?
3. Describe your PostgreSQL schema design and indexing strategies for high-read systems.
4. Explain Redis caching strategies and how you handle cache invalidation.
5. Share your Dockerfile optimization techniques and multi-stage builds.
6. How do you deploy and manage services on Kubernetes? Cover Pods, Deployments, and Helm.
7. Discuss your testing strategy: unit vs. integration, mocking external services.
8. Describe a system-design scenario: architect a microservice to handle 1M requests/day.

**Behavioral:**

1. Tell me about a time you resolved a production incident under pressure.
2. How do you give and receive feedback during code reviews?
3. Describe a project where you collaborated with frontend/product. What challenges arose and how did you overcome them?
4. How have you mentored junior engineers or led a small project?
5. Give an example of how you introduced a process improvement (e.g., CI/CD, monitoring).

## Questions to Ask Them

1. How is work divided between new feature development, maintenance, and refactoring?
2. What are the top technical challenges your backend team faces right now?
3. Can you describe your release cadence and CI/CD pipeline?
4. What SLAs or performance benchmarks does the team aim to meet?
5. How do you handle secrets and configuration in your Kubernetes clusters?
6. What opportunities for mentorship and leadership exist for this role?
7. How does the company support ongoing learning and certifications?
8. With the onsite requirement, how do you ensure work-life balance and flexible hours in practice?

## Concepts To Know/Review

- FastAPI internals: routing, dependency injection, async I/O
- Pydantic models and validation
- REST principles: versioning, HATEOAS, OpenAPI/Swagger
- PostgreSQL: ACID properties, indexing, query optimization
- Redis: data types, pub/sub, eviction policies, cache patterns
- Docker: multi-stage builds, image layering, security best practices
- Kubernetes: Core objects (Pod, Service, Deployment), Helm charts, rollbacks
- Testing: Pytest fixtures, mocking, coverage strategies
- Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus metrics exposition, Grafana dashboards, centralized logging with Loki
- Microservices design: service discovery, circuit breakers, load balancing

## Strategic Advice

- **Tone & Demeanor:** Convey confidence but stay humble. Use precise technical language and highlight impact metrics (e.g., “reduced latency by 30%,” “served 10k+ req/day”).
- **Focus Areas:** Emphasize your hands-on FastAPI and Kubernetes experience. Tie every technical story back to performance, reliability, or collaboration.
- **Handling Missing Skills:** You lack GraphQL—acknowledge it honestly, then pivot to your readiness to learn (cite quick upskilling examples).
- **Red Flags to Watch For:**
  - **Onsite Policy:** Clarify expectations around daily office presence and flexible hours.
  - **Visa Sponsorship:** Confirm no sponsorship—ensure your status aligns.
  - **Workload Balance:** Probe for support during high-pressure releases to avoid burnout.
- **Closing the Interview:** Reiterate your excitement for ABC’s performance-driven culture and how you envision contributing from day one (e.g., “I’d start by reviewing our current FastAPI benchmarks and proposing optimizations…”).
- **Next Steps:** Ask about timeline and follow-up process, expressing eagerness to move forward.

Good luck! You’re set to demonstrate both technical depth and strategic alignment with ABC Corp’s values.
